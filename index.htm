                    <br />

Blazor provides a web development standard that can be applied to mobile, web, or desktop applications.</span>

On the server-side, organizations have sacrificed performance to use node.js with JavaScript, instead of, a compiled, and very performant, .NET application written in C sharp. On the client-side, organizations would choose React, Angular, or Vue.js, because they were the best options a few years ago. For organizations that prefer the Microsoft Stack, Blazor is now usually the best choice.</span>

No matter which code-base you are coming from, or evolving, software development teams should take an iterative approach and deliver updates frequently. I can help with all of these aspects.</span>

This allows for 24/7 access to my 30+ years of experience that can be structured as coaching, training, small cohort, or consulting. It is like insurance for your software development team moving forward within the Microsoft Stack. For first-time clients, this is usually the best and safest choice. The price for an Advisory engagement is usually within four figures, and the average engagement usually spans across four weeks to get the results you expect.</span>

The price for a Solution engagement is usually within six figures, and the target for deliverables usually begin after four weeks, and the duration of the creating, implementing, and transferring the solution usually takes six to twelve months.</span>
